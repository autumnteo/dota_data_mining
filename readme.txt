****Description****

Model 1: Improve current predictor models by adding certain feactures such Hero Counter Rate, Hero synergy.

Model 2: Build a Hero recommendation system which can recommend to the player the best 5 Heroes that maximizes their chances of winning a match.

We totally got 5 folders:
